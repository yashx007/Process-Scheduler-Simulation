# Process Scheduler Simulation

This project simulates CPU scheduling algorithms (Round Robin and Priority Scheduling with preemption) using C++ and POSIX threads. It includes:
- Process structure
- Scheduler logic
- Thread management
- Synchronization
- Gantt chart visualization (text-based)
- Calculation of wait and turnaround times

## How to Build
Use a C++ compiler that supports POSIX threads (e.g., g++, MinGW-w64 on Windows, or Linux/macOS).

## How to Run
Compile and run the main executable. The program will prompt for process details and scheduling algorithm selection.

## Features
- Simulates concurrent process execution
- Supports preemptive Round Robin and Priority Scheduling
- Displays Gantt chart and statistics

## Requirements
- C++11 or later
- POSIX threads (pthreads)

This README will be updated as the project is implemented.
