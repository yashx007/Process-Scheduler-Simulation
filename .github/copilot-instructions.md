# Copilot Instructions for Process Scheduler Simulation

- [x] Clarified project requirements: C++ process scheduler simulation with Round Robin and Priority Scheduling (preemptive), POSIX threads, Gantt chart, wait/turnaround times.
- [ ] Scaffold the project: Create main source files and folders.
- [ ] Customize the project: Implement scheduler logic, threading, synchronization, and visualization.
- [ ] Compile the project: Ensure build works and resolve errors.
- [ ] Launch the project: Run and verify output.
- [ ] Ensure documentation is complete: Update README and instructions.

Work through each checklist item systematically. Keep communication concise and focused. Follow development best practices.
